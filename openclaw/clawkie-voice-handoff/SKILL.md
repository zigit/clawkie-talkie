description: Use when a user asks for their Clawkie/Clawkie-Talkie dashboard URL/link, asks to switch to voice, move/continue this conversation by voice, start Clawkie/Clawkie-Talkie voice, create a Clawkie voice handoff/link, or says phrases like "do clawkie voice handoff". Return the Clawkie Talkie dashboard URL from the configured daemon host ID, or build a direct voice handoff URL from the current OpenClaw session context when explicitly requested.

# Clawkie Voice Handoff

When the user asks for their Clawkie dashboard URL/link, reply with the host dashboard URL for the configured daemon.

When the user explicitly asks to switch the current OpenClaw session to voice, reply with a direct Clawkie Talkie voice URL for this exact conversation.

## Install State

The installer patches the runtime-installed copy of this skill (not the repo source) with the values it generated when it configured the local daemon:

- INSTALLED = false
- Install date:
- CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID = `<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>`

`CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` is the stable daemon host UUID the installer generated and wrote to the daemon's `.env` as `DAEMON_PEER_ID`. The runtime-installed skill stores the same UUID and uses it directly when building a handoff URL. The repo-source copy keeps a non-secret sentinel in the configuration bullet above so it cannot leak a real machine ID.

If `INSTALLED` is not `true`, or `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` is empty / not replaced with a real host ID, do not generate a link. Reply:

```txt
I can’t create the Clawkie link: Clawkie Talkie is not installed/configured for this OpenClaw runtime.
```

## Hard rules

- Do **not** call a Clawkie helper just to create the URL.
- Do **not** call the Clawkie daemon to create or mutate handoff state.
- Do **not** create or reference handoff IDs, opaque tokens, registries, TTLs, claims, revocations, or lookup tables.
- Do **not** guess the current session id/key. A session id/key is not needed for dashboard URL requests.
- Do **not** guess routing fields. Include `channel`, `target`, and `accountId` only when they are visible in trusted runtime/session context.
- Trusted explicit delivery routing is not Discord-only. Preserve non-Discord surfaces exactly as exposed by runtime/session context, including direct-chat providers such as Telegram. If trusted context exposes `channel=telegram`, a Telegram chat/user `target`, and `accountId`, the generated hash must include `channel=telegram&target=<target>&accountId=<accountId>`.
- Do **not** fall back to `agent:main:main` for Telegram/direct-chat or other external surfaces. If no exact current `session` value is visible for that surface, stop and report the missing `session` field instead of generating a web-chat URL.
- Use the configured `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` exactly as installed.
- If a required field is unavailable, say exactly which field is missing.

## Dashboard URL contract

For requests like “what's my Clawkie dashboard URL?”, “give me my Clawkie dashboard link”, or “what is the Clawkie Talkie dashboard link?”, generate only this public dashboard URL shape:

```txt
https://clawkietalkie.app/dashboard/#host=<host>
```

Use `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` as `<host>`. Do not include a `session`, `sessionKey`, `channel`, `target`, or `accountId` in dashboard URLs.

The dashboard is the normal user-facing phone entry point. It lets the user select from Recent OpenClaw Sessions exposed by the configured daemon.

## Direct voice URL contract

Use this only when the user explicitly asks to switch/open/continue a particular current conversation by voice.

Generate only this public handoff URL shape:

```txt
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=<host>&session=<sessionId>&sessionKey=<sessionKey>&channel=<channel>&target=<target>&accountId=<accountId>
```

`sessionKey`, `channel`, `target`, and `accountId` are optional only when those values are not visible. Include them whenever they are visible in trusted runtime/session context. `session` remains the session identity passed to `openclaw agent --session-id`; `sessionKey` selects the OpenClaw agent and can derive Discord reply/transcript routing; `channel` + `target` are the explicit originating reply route and are also used for best-effort transcript mirroring. This explicit route is provider-agnostic: for Telegram/direct-chat contexts, preserve the trusted Telegram `channel`, `target`/chat id, and `accountId` in the hash so the daemon can call OpenClaw with `--reply-channel telegram --reply-to <target> --reply-account <accountId>` and transcript mirroring can use `openclaw message send --channel telegram --target <target> --account <accountId>`. If only a session key is visible, put that key in `session` and omit `sessionKey`. For OpenClaw web chat, `session=agent:main:main` is valid only as that fallback. If `target` is included, include `channel` too.

Use hash args so `sessionId`, session keys, and UUID-like values are not sent to web servers. Query params are compatibility-only; do not generate them unless explicitly requested.

`/voice` is the public handoff entrypoint. The browser joins the configured daemon rendezvous room first. The daemon derives the per-session voice room deterministically from `host + session` and runs the OpenClaw agent turn with explicit reply delivery: `--deliver --reply-channel <channel> --reply-to <target>`. The selected agent comes from `sessionKey`, a colon-style session key in `session`, or a UUID reverse-resolved through OpenClaw's session list. Assistant reply delivery to the originating channel/thread is mandatory for delivered voice turns; transcript mirroring is daemon-side best-effort.

## Required values

### `host`

Use `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` from the installed configuration section above.

If it is missing or not a real host ID, stop and say:

```txt
I can’t create the Clawkie link: missing Clawkie host ID.
```

### `session`

Required only for direct `/voice` handoff URLs. Do not require this for dashboard URL requests.

Use the current OpenClaw agent **actual sessionId** for `session` when it is visible in trusted runtime/session context. This is the safe transcript/session id, e.g. a UUID-like value:

```txt
c44d9502-ce71-46b1-9b15-5d548004544a
```

If both a session key and an actual sessionId are visible, put the actual sessionId in `session` and the exact colon-style key in `sessionKey`. Do not choose the colon-style key as `session` just because it is human-readable.

If the actual sessionId is not visible, use an exact current OpenClaw session key from trusted runtime/session context, e.g.:

```txt
agent:main:discord:channel:1498020851298209852
agent:main:slack:channel:C123:thread:1710000000.000100
agent:codex:acp:binding:discord:default:feedface
```

For internal web chat, the canonical main-session key is:

```txt
agent:main:main
```

Use `agent:main:main` only when the trusted runtime context is actually the OpenClaw web chat / internal main session and no actual sessionId is visible. Do not use it as a fallback for Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, ACP, subagent, custom, direct-message, or bound sessions. For Telegram/direct-chat surfaces with visible routing but no visible exact session id/key, report `missing session`; do not generate a main web-chat handoff.

If no exact current session id/key is visible, do not invent one. For ordinary main group/channel sessions only, deriving a session-key fallback from OpenClaw’s session-key convention is acceptable when all parts are certain:

```txt
agent:<agentId>:<channel>:<chat_id>
```

Example:

```txt
agent:main:discord:channel:1498020851298209852
```

Do not derive ACP, subagent, custom, direct-message, or bound session keys unless the exact session key is visible.


## Build the URL

URL-encode all hash values. Equivalent JS:

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.set('host', CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID);
params.set('session', sessionId);
if (sessionKey) params.set('sessionKey', sessionKey);
if (channel && target) {
  params.set('channel', channel);
  params.set('target', target);
}
if (accountId) params.set('accountId', accountId);
const url = `https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#${params.toString()}`;
```

For Telegram direct-chat context with trusted values like `session=<uuid>`, `channel=telegram`, `target=chat:<id>` (or the exact target shape exposed by OpenClaw), and `accountId=<account>`, the resulting hash must include all three routing fields alongside `host` and `session`; never replace the session with `agent:main:main`.

## Response format

Keep dashboard replies short:

```txt
Clawkie dashboard: <url>
```

Keep direct voice handoff replies short:

```txt
Switch to voice: <url>
```

If blocked:

```txt
I can’t create the Clawkie link: missing <field>.
```

## Example: current sessionId UUID plus visible session key

Given current actual sessionId:

```txt
c44d9502-ce71-46b1-9b15-5d548004544a
```

and current session key:

```txt
agent:main:discord:channel:1498020851298209852
```

reply:

```txt
Switch to voice: https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=<configured-host>&session=c44d9502-ce71-46b1-9b15-5d548004544a&sessionKey=agent%3Amain%3Adiscord%3Achannel%3A1498020851298209852&channel=discord&target=channel%3A1498020851298209852
```

Replace `<configured-host>` with `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` from the installed copy of this skill.
