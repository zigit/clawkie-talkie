# Clawkie Talkie

Clawkie Talkie is a browser voice surface for OpenClaw sessions.

A local daemon runs on the user's machine, keeps private credentials local, connects to OpenClaw, and speaks to the browser over WebRTC. The hosted browser client opens voice handoff links such as:

```text
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=<host>&session=<session>&channel=<channel>&target=<target>
```
