# Voice Handoff (Deterministic Rendezvous)

## User story

1. User is in an OpenClaw session on any channel/surface.
2. User says "switch to voice".
3. The agent posts a Clawkie-Talkie `/voice#…` link built directly from the
   current OpenClaw turn — no helper script, no daemon API call, no
   pre-created link record.
4. User opens the link.
5. User speaks. Clawkie transcribes, optionally mirrors the transcript into
   the originating external conversation, runs the OpenClaw session, and speaks
   the reply back.

## Old singleton architecture

Before this design the daemon was single-session: one phone at a time, one
shared `activeSessionId` / `activeThreadId`, one set of WebRTC/STT/TTS
singletons. Two threads asking the user to "switch to voice" produced two
links to the same lane and stomped on each other.

## Deterministic rendezvous

There is now exactly one durable local daemon. `host=H` is a stable
rendezvous/control identity, not the voice lane.

For each handoff the agent fills the URL with values already present in the
turn. External deliveries include `target`; webchat/internal session-only links
omit it:

```
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=H&session=<sessionId>&channel=<channel>&target=<target>
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=H&session=agent:main:main&channel=webchat
```

The browser:

1. Joins the rendezvous room `H`.
2. Sends `rendezvous.join { sessionId, delivery?: { channel, target? } }` once.
   For webchat/internal session-only links, `delivery` may be absent or may be
   `{ channel: "webchat" }` with no `target`.
3. Receives `rendezvous.accept { roomId }`, where
   `roomId = makeVoiceRoomId({ hostPeerId: H, sessionId })`.
4. Reconnects to `roomId` and runs the voice turn there.

The daemon derives the same `roomId` deterministically. There is no
pre-created link record, random join id, TTL, claim, revocation, or central
session store.

The only daemon state that survives between turns is `roomId -> VoiceSession`
for actively connected voice rooms — necessary because WebRTC/STT/TTS need
live objects.

## URL contract

- `/` — marketing landing page placeholder.
- `/voice` — public user-facing voice handoff path. Forwards to `/voice.html`
  while preserving both `?…` and `#…`.
- `/voice.html` — voice app HTML.

Required handoff args (accepted from hash fragment, then query string):

- `host` — daemon rendezvous/control room id
- `session` — OpenClaw session key/id, passed later to
  `openclaw agent --session-id`. For webchat-only handoffs, use
  `agent:main:main` when no more specific exact key is visible; the daemon runs
  `openclaw agent --agent main --session-id agent:main:main --channel last --deliver`.
  Older `agent:main:webchat` links are normalized to this webchat session-only form.
- `channel` — source channel/surface. For external delivery this is passed later to
  `openclaw message send --channel`.
- `target` — optional OpenClaw delivery target. For external delivery, this is
  required and passed later to `openclaw message send --target`. For
  webchat/internal session-only links, omit `target`; the daemon does not call
  `openclaw message send` and uses OpenClaw channel-last delivery for the agent turn.

Hash wins over query when both are present. All values must be URL-encoded.

Examples:

```
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=H&session=S&channel=discord&target=channel%3A123
https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#host=H&session=S&channel=webchat
```

### Why hash-first?

Hash fragments are not transmitted on HTTP requests, so `host`, `session`,
`channel`, and `target` never reach a web server. The browser parses them
locally and sends them only over the encrypted WebRTC DataChannel to the
local daemon.

## Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Agent as OpenClaw Agent
  participant Phone as Browser Client
  participant Host as Daemon Host/Rendezvous H
  participant Room as Voice Room H:session
  participant OC as OpenClaw Session

  User->>Agent: switch to voice
  Agent-->>User: /voice#host=H&session=A&channel=C&target=T
  User->>Phone: open link
  Phone->>Host: rendezvous.join(session A, optional delivery C/T)
  Host->>Host: derive room H:A
  Host-->>Phone: rendezvous.accept(room H:A)
  Phone->>Room: WebRTC voice connection
  User->>Phone: speak
  Room->>OC: openclaw message send --channel C --target T (external only)
  Room->>OC: openclaw agent --session-id A
  OC-->>Room: reply text
  Room-->>Phone: TTS audio
```

## Failure states

- `rendezvous.error("missing_session")` — required session field missing.
- `rendezvous.error("invalid_delivery")` — external delivery is partial;
  use either no delivery, webchat delivery without target, or a complete
  external channel+target.
- `rendezvous.error("too_many_voice_sessions")` — daemon at active-room cap
  and the requested session is not already active.
- `rendezvous.error("unexpected_message")` — first message on the rendezvous
  lane was not `rendezvous.join`.

## Testing checklist

- `npm test` — unit/contract tests including `voiceRoom`, `voiceSession`,
  `protocol`, `chatSession`, `appRouting`, `appEntry`,
  `multiSessionRendezvous`.
- `npm run typecheck` — client and daemon TypeScript.
- `npm run build` — Vite multi-page build emits `/`, `/voice.html`, and
  `/voice/index.html`.
- Live verification (only with explicit authorization): two simultaneous
  `/voice#…` links pointing at the same `host=H` but different `session`
  values must reach READY independently and not cross-talk.
