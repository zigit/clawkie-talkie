# Clawkie Talkie — Agent Install Instructions

These instructions are for an agent installing, reinstalling, or upgrading Clawkie Talkie on a user's Mac or Linux machine.

Your goals:

1. Install or upgrade the Clawkie Talkie daemon from this repo.
2. Configure it with user-provided credentials and a stable daemon host ID.
3. Make it persistent after login/reboot.
4. Install the OpenClaw `clawkie-voice-handoff` skill so the user can say "switch to voice" and receive a working handoff link.
5. Verify the daemon and skill configuration before reporting success.

Do not install credentials into the browser. The daemon holds credentials locally; the browser receives only voice handoff URLs.

## Safety rules

- Do not commit `.env`, API keys, generated host IDs, LaunchAgent plists with private paths, or systemd unit files with private paths.
- Do not paste or print the xAI API key in chat/log summaries.
- Before asking the user for an xAI key, check the local OpenClaw configuration and auth profiles for an existing configured xAI key. A missing `XAI_API_KEY` shell environment variable is **not** enough reason to ask the user to paste a key.
- Treat `DAEMON_PEER_ID` as private-ish: not a password, but do not publish it or post it in public channels.
- Use the public Clawkie Talkie client origin and the persistent daemon path; do not use local development shortcuts for an end-user install.
- Do not start/stop unrelated services.
- If OpenClaw is not installed/configured, stop and report the missing prerequisite. If no usable xAI key exists after checking local OpenClaw config/auth profiles and any user-designated secret source, ask for a safe secret handoff path; do not ask the user to paste the key into a public/shared chat.

Public GitHub repo: `davidguttman/clawkietalkie`

## Choose install mode first

Before fetching or replacing files, decide which mode applies:

- **Fresh install:** no existing Clawkie Talkie source directory, daemon `.env`, persistence service, or installed OpenClaw handoff skill exists.
- **Upgrade:** Clawkie Talkie is already installed and should keep the same `.env`, `DAEMON_PEER_ID`, persistence method, and installed skill configuration while code/docs are refreshed.
- **Reinstall/repair:** an install exists but source files or dependencies are broken. Treat it like an upgrade: preserve secrets and IDs first, then replace code.

For upgrades/reinstalls, do **not** delete the existing source directory until you have preserved and verified:

- repo-root `.env`
- the existing `DAEMON_PEER_ID`
- the installed OpenClaw skill's `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID`
- the active persistence mechanism (`launchd` or `systemd --user`)

The preserved daemon `DAEMON_PEER_ID` and installed skill `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` must stay identical after the upgrade.

## Fetch and inspect

1. Identify the installing agent's own OpenClaw workspace directory from the current runtime/session context. Do **not** invent a separate home-directory workspace and do **not** copy any path from this repository author's machine. If the active OpenClaw workspace cannot be determined, stop and ask the user.

   For a fresh install, download the GitHub source ZIP into that workspace, for example under `<OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE>/external/clawkie-talkie`. Refuse to overwrite an existing target in this mode:

   ```bash
   OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE="/absolute/path/to/this-openclaw-workspace"
   CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR="$OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE/external/clawkie-talkie"

   if [ -e "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR" ]; then
     echo "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR already exists; use the upgrade/reinstall flow instead of overwriting it" >&2
     exit 1
   fi

   workdir=$(mktemp -d)
   trap 'rm -rf "$workdir"' EXIT
   cd "$workdir"
   curl -L -o clawkie-talkie.zip \
     https://github.com/davidguttman/clawkietalkie/archive/HEAD.zip
   unzip -q clawkie-talkie.zip
   extracted_dir=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'clawkietalkie-*' | head -n 1)
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR")"
   mv "$extracted_dir" "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR"
   cd "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR"
   ```
2. Inspect the repo before installing. Expected items include:
   - Node/npm project files
   - TypeScript daemon under `daemon/src/`
   - browser client under `client/`
   - OpenClaw skill under `openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md`
   - docs under `docs/`
3. Suspicious items to stop on:
   - unexpected credential collection beyond `.env` / user-provided API key
   - unexpected remote shell execution
   - install-time scripts that mutate global state without user consent
   - code that exfiltrates `.env`, OpenClaw config, browser cookies, or arbitrary files

## Upgrade or reinstall/repair an existing install

Use this flow when `CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR` already exists, the daemon has run before, or the OpenClaw handoff skill is already installed.

1. Locate the current source directory. Prefer the configured service command/path if it exists; otherwise use the known install path under the OpenClaw workspace.
2. Preserve current local configuration before touching source files:

   ```bash
   : "${CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR:?set to existing Clawkie Talkie source directory}"
   cd "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR"

   test -f .env || { echo "missing .env; stop and ask before reinstalling" >&2; exit 1; }
   chmod 600 .env
   DAEMON_PEER_ID=$(awk -F= '/^DAEMON_PEER_ID=/{print $2; exit}' .env)
   test -n "$DAEMON_PEER_ID" || { echo "missing DAEMON_PEER_ID in .env; stop before changing files" >&2; exit 1; }
   ```

   Do not print the xAI key. Do not generate a new daemon peer ID unless the user explicitly asks to create a new identity.

3. Stop only the Clawkie Talkie user service while replacing files:

   - macOS: unload/stop the `app.clawkietalkie.daemon` LaunchAgent for the current user.
   - Linux: `systemctl --user stop clawkie-talkie.service`.

   Do not stop unrelated OpenClaw, browser, Docker, or system services.

4. Refresh the source safely:

   - If the source directory is a git checkout and has no relevant local changes, use `git fetch --prune` followed by a fast-forward update to the desired branch/revision.
   - If the source came from a ZIP or the git state is unclear, download a fresh ZIP into a temporary directory and copy it over the existing source while preserving local runtime files:

   ```bash
   : "${CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR:?set to existing Clawkie Talkie source directory}"
   workdir=$(mktemp -d)
   trap 'rm -rf "$workdir"' EXIT
   cd "$workdir"

   curl -L -o clawkie-talkie.zip \
     https://github.com/davidguttman/clawkietalkie/archive/HEAD.zip
   unzip -q clawkie-talkie.zip
   extracted_dir=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'clawkietalkie-*' | head -n 1)

   rsync -a --delete \
     --exclude '.env' \
     --exclude 'node_modules' \
     --exclude '.git' \
     "$extracted_dir"/ "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR"/

   cd "$CLAWKIE_SOURCE_DIR"
   ```

5. Run dependency install again from the source directory:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. Reinstall/update the OpenClaw skill from the refreshed source, then patch the installed copy using the preserved `DAEMON_PEER_ID`. Never leave the installed skill with `<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>` after an upgrade.
7. Restart only the Clawkie Talkie user service and run the same daemon, service, and skill verification checks listed below.
8. If verification fails, keep the preserved `.env` and report the failing command/output. Do not keep retrying with a new host ID.

## Prerequisites to verify

From the user's shell account that will run the daemon:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
command -v openclaw
openclaw status
```

Use Node 22 LTS or newer when possible. If `openclaw` is missing or not configured, stop and tell the user OpenClaw must be installed/configured first.

## Install dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
```

`@roamhq/wrtc` normally installs a prebuilt native package for supported macOS/Linux architectures. If it fails, install platform build tools and retry. See `docs/install-daemon.md` for platform-specific notes.

## Configure `.env`

For a fresh install, create the repo-root `.env` file from the example. For an upgrade/reinstall, preserve the existing `.env` and skip this copy step unless the file is missing and the user approved recreating it:

```bash
if [ ! -f .env ]; then
  cp .env.example .env
fi
chmod 600 .env
```

You — the installer — generate one stable daemon host UUID for this machine. The same UUID goes into the daemon's `.env` as `DAEMON_PEER_ID` and into the runtime-installed handoff skill as `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID`. This works the same way LobsterLink stores its discovered Chrome extension ID into the LobsterLink skill: a value generated/discovered at install time, written into the runtime skill, and used directly thereafter. The user does not need to know or configure this UUID.

Generate it once:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomUUID())"
```

Set these values in `.env`:

```env
XAI_API_KEY=<xai-key-from-local-openclaw-config-or-user-approved-secret-source>
DAEMON_PEER_ID=<installer-generated-uuid>
```

Credential source order for `XAI_API_KEY`:

1. Preserve an existing repo-root `.env` value if this is an upgrade/reinstall and it is already present.
2. Check the local OpenClaw config/auth profile for an existing xAI API key. Use `openclaw config file`/`openclaw config get ...` or the runtime's config tooling to find the active config; if the value is a SecretRef, resolve it through the configured local secret provider. Copy the key locally into `.env` without printing it.
3. Check only user-designated local secret sources, if the user already named one.
4. Only then ask the user for a safe way to provide the key. Do **not** tell them to paste it into chat.

When reporting a blocker, be specific: say whether the key was absent from OpenClaw config, present but unresolved, or unavailable because the secret provider was locked/unconfigured. Do not summarize that as merely "no key in the shell environment."

Do not regenerate the UUID on later updates, reinstalls, dependency repairs, or service repairs — keep it stable so existing handoff links and the installed skill remain valid.

The installed daemon defaults the client origin to `https://clawkietalkie.app`, so `CT_CLIENT_ORIGIN` is not required. Only set it as an override if the user explicitly wants to point at a non-default client deployment. The signaling server is also non-configurable for end-user installs.

Optional `.env` values:

```env
CT_STT_LANGUAGE=en
CT_THREAD_ID=
# Override the default client origin (https://clawkietalkie.app):
# CT_CLIENT_ORIGIN=
```

## Manual daemon verification

Run once from the repo root:

```bash
npm run daemon
```

Success looks like:

```text
Peer ID:  <DAEMON_PEER_ID>
Join URL: https://clawkietalkie.app/?host=<DAEMON_PEER_ID>
Waiting for phone…
```

Verify the printed `Peer ID` matches `.env` exactly. Stop the manual run with `Ctrl-C` before installing the persistent service.

## Install persistence

Use `docs/install-daemon.md` for the exact launchd/systemd examples.

Required verification after persistence is installed:

- macOS: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/app.clawkietalkie.daemon`
- Linux: `systemctl --user status clawkie-talkie.service`
- Logs include `Peer ID: <DAEMON_PEER_ID>` or `subscribed to rendezvous room as <DAEMON_PEER_ID>`
- The service restarts cleanly after a manual restart command.

## Install the OpenClaw skill

The skill source is:

```text
openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md
```

Install it into the runtime skills directory for **this OpenClaw install's workspace**. Use the workspace path from the current runtime/session context; do not hardcode the maintainer's workspace path or any other user-specific path.

If the runtime exposes a specific skills directory, use it. Otherwise use `<OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE>/skills`. If you cannot determine the active workspace or skills directory, stop and report that blocker.

Create the destination directory and copy the skill:

```bash
: "${OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE:?set this to the installing agent's OpenClaw workspace directory}"
OPENCLAW_SKILLS_DIR="${OPENCLAW_SKILLS_DIR:-$OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE/skills}"
CLAWKIE_SKILL_DIR="$OPENCLAW_SKILLS_DIR/clawkie-voice-handoff"

mkdir -p "$CLAWKIE_SKILL_DIR"
cp openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md "$CLAWKIE_SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md"
```

Then patch the installed copy only (mirroring how the LobsterLink installer writes its discovered extension ID into the LobsterLink runtime skill):

- `INSTALLED = false` → `INSTALLED = true`
- `Install date:` → today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID = `<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>`` → the exact `DAEMON_PEER_ID` from `.env`

Do not patch the source copy in the repo with the real host ID.

Invariant: the daemon `.env` `DAEMON_PEER_ID` must equal the installed skill's `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID`. If they ever diverge, the skill emits handoff links that point at the wrong rendezvous room.

## Verify the skill install

Before claiming success:

A robust check should parse the configured host line instead of grepping the entire file for placeholder words. For example:

```bash
configured_host=$(awk -F'= ' '/^- CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID = / {gsub(/`/, "", $2); print $2; exit}' "$CLAWKIE_SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md")
test "$configured_host" = "$DAEMON_PEER_ID"
```

1. Confirm the installed skill exists at the runtime path.
2. Confirm the installed skill says `INSTALLED = true`.
3. Confirm the installed skill's **configuration bullet** for `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` was patched from the repo placeholder to the daemon `.env` `DAEMON_PEER_ID`. Do not fail the install just because explanatory prose elsewhere mentions placeholders.
4. Confirm no active config line remains exactly `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID = `<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>``.
5. Confirm the installed skill's `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` matches the daemon `.env` `DAEMON_PEER_ID`.
6. Construct a dry-run handoff URL using the same algorithm as the skill:

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.set('host', daemonPeerId);
params.set('session', 'agent:main:discord:channel:EXAMPLE');
params.set('channel', 'discord');
params.set('target', 'channel:EXAMPLE');
console.log(`https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#${params.toString()}`);
```

The dry-run URL must include `host`, `session`, `channel`, and `target` in the hash.

## Required final report

Report only non-secret facts:

- Install mode: fresh install, upgrade, or reinstall/repair
- Daemon source path
- Whether dependencies installed
- Whether `.env` exists and contains required keys, without printing key values
- Whether `DAEMON_PEER_ID` is stable/configured, without printing it unless the user explicitly asks
- Persistence method installed: launchd or systemd user service
- Service status/log evidence
- Skill destination path
- Skill configured: yes/no
- Verification commands run
- Any blockers

Do not report the xAI API key. Avoid posting the daemon host ID into public/shared chat unless necessary.
