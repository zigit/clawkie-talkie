# Clawkie Talkie — Agent Install Instructions

These instructions are for an agent installing Clawkie Talkie on a user's Mac or Linux machine.

Your goals:

1. Install the Clawkie Talkie daemon from this repo.
2. Configure it with user-provided credentials and a stable daemon host ID.
3. Make it persistent after login/reboot.
4. Install the OpenClaw `clawkie-voice-handoff` skill so the user can say "switch to voice" and receive a working handoff link.
5. Verify the daemon and skill configuration before reporting success.

Do not install credentials into the browser. The daemon holds credentials locally; the browser receives only voice handoff URLs.

## Safety rules

- Do not commit `.env`, API keys, generated host IDs, LaunchAgent plists with private paths, or systemd unit files with private paths.
- Do not paste or print the xAI API key in chat/log summaries.
- Treat `DAEMON_PEER_ID` as private-ish: not a password, but do not publish it or post it in public channels.
- Use the public Clawkie Talkie client origin and the persistent daemon path; do not use local development shortcuts for an end-user install.
- Do not start/stop unrelated services.
- If the user has not provided an xAI API key or OpenClaw is not installed/configured, stop and report the missing prerequisite.

## Source

Public GitHub repo: `davidguttman/clawkietalkie`

## Fetch, inspect, and install location

Use the same safety shape as LobsterLink: fetch a clean public copy, inspect it before trusting it, then run the long-lived install from a durable path. For Clawkie Talkie, that durable path should be inside the installing agent's OpenClaw workspace, because this is an agent-owned daemon plus skill install. Do not use a local development checkout, a temporary worktree, or another agent's workspace.

OpenClaw's default workspace is `~/.openclaw/workspace`, but `agents.defaults.workspace` may point somewhere else. Agents should use their active workspace directory as the source of truth. In normal tool execution, that is the current working directory.

Default target inside the agent workspace:

```text
<agent-workspace>/clawkie-talkie
```

Example Git flow from the agent workspace:

```bash
workspace="$(pwd)"
target="$workspace/clawkie-talkie"
if [ -e "$target" ]; then
  echo "$target already exists; preserve .env and stop unless this is an approved update" >&2
  exit 1
fi
git clone https://github.com/davidguttman/clawkietalkie.git "$target"
cd "$target"
# inspect this repo before running install commands
```

If using the ZIP, download and extract it locally, inspect it, then copy or move the extracted repo to `<agent-workspace>/clawkie-talkie` before running install commands. Do not run the persistent daemon from a temporary unzip directory. If `<agent-workspace>/clawkie-talkie` already exists, preserve `.env` and stop before replacing anything unless the user explicitly approved an update.

Expected items to inspect before installing:

- Node/npm project files
- TypeScript daemon under `daemon/src/`
- browser client under `client/`
- OpenClaw skill under `openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md`
- docs under `docs/`

Suspicious items to stop on:

- unexpected credential collection beyond `.env` / user-provided API key
- unexpected remote shell execution
- install-time scripts that mutate global state without user consent
- code that exfiltrates `.env`, OpenClaw config, browser cookies, or arbitrary files

## Prerequisites to verify

From the user's shell account that will run the daemon:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
command -v openclaw
openclaw status
```

Use Node 22 LTS or newer when possible. If `openclaw` is missing or not configured, stop and tell the user OpenClaw must be installed/configured first.

## Install dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
```

`@roamhq/wrtc` normally installs a prebuilt native package for supported macOS/Linux architectures. If it fails, install platform build tools and retry. See `docs/install-daemon.md` for platform-specific notes.

## Configure `.env`

Create the repo-root `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
```

Set these values:

```env
XAI_API_KEY=<user-provided-xai-key>
DAEMON_PEER_ID=<generated-stable-uuid>
CT_CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://clawkietalkie.app
```

Generate the stable host ID once:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomUUID())"
```

Put that UUID in `.env` as `DAEMON_PEER_ID`. Do not regenerate it on later updates. The OpenClaw handoff skill and browser links depend on this value staying stable.

Optional `.env` values:

```env
SIGNAL_SERVER=
CT_STT_LANGUAGE=en
CT_THREAD_ID=
```

## Manual daemon verification

Run once from the repo root:

```bash
npm run daemon
```

Success looks like:

```text
Peer ID:  <DAEMON_PEER_ID>
Join URL: https://clawkietalkie.app/?host=<DAEMON_PEER_ID>
Waiting for phone…
```

Verify the printed `Peer ID` matches `.env` exactly. Stop the manual run with `Ctrl-C` before installing the persistent service.

## Install persistence

Use `docs/install-daemon.md` for the exact launchd/systemd examples.

Required verification after persistence is installed:

- macOS: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/app.clawkietalkie.daemon`
- Linux: `systemctl --user status clawkie-talkie.service`
- Logs include `Peer ID: <DAEMON_PEER_ID>` or `subscribed to rendezvous room as <DAEMON_PEER_ID>`
- The service restarts cleanly after a manual restart command.

## Install the OpenClaw skill

The skill source is:

```text
openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md
```

Install it into the OpenClaw runtime skills directory for this user. In a standard OpenClaw workspace, this is usually:

```text
~/clawd/skills/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md
```

If this path does not exist, discover the active skills directory from the current OpenClaw runtime/session context. Do not guess. If you cannot determine the runtime skill path, stop and report that blocker.

Create the destination directory and copy the skill:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/clawd/skills/clawkie-voice-handoff
cp openclaw/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md ~/clawd/skills/clawkie-voice-handoff/SKILL.md
```

Then patch the installed copy only:

- `INSTALLED = false` → `INSTALLED = true`
- `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID = "<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>"` → the exact `DAEMON_PEER_ID` from `.env`
- `INSTALL_DATE = ""` → today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

Do not patch the source copy in the repo with the user's host ID.

## Verify the skill install

Before claiming success:

1. Confirm the installed skill exists at the runtime path.
2. Confirm the installed skill no longer contains `<CONFIGURE_DAEMON_PEER_ID>`.
3. Confirm the installed skill says `INSTALLED = true`.
4. Confirm the installed skill's `CLAWKIE_DAEMON_HOST_ID` matches the daemon `.env` `DAEMON_PEER_ID`.
5. Construct a dry-run handoff URL using the same algorithm as the skill:

```js
const params = new URLSearchParams();
params.set('host', daemonPeerId);
params.set('session', 'agent:main:discord:channel:EXAMPLE');
params.set('channel', 'discord');
params.set('target', 'channel:EXAMPLE');
console.log(`https://clawkietalkie.app/voice#${params.toString()}`);
```

The dry-run URL must include `host`, `session`, `channel`, and `target` in the hash.

## Required final report

Report only non-secret facts:

- Daemon source path
- Whether dependencies installed
- Whether `.env` exists and contains required keys, without printing key values
- Whether `DAEMON_PEER_ID` is stable/configured, without printing it unless the user explicitly asks
- Persistence method installed: launchd or systemd user service
- Service status/log evidence
- Skill destination path
- Skill configured: yes/no
- Verification commands run
- Any blockers

Do not report the xAI API key. Avoid posting the daemon host ID into public/shared chat unless necessary.
